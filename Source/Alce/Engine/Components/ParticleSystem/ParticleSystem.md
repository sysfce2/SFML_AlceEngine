# üß© ParticleSystem

The ```ParticleSystem``` component manages the emission, update, and destruction of multiple particles.
It defines when and where particles are spawned, and applies a user-defined configuration function (behavior lambda) to each one.
Typical use cases include explosions, fire, smoke, sparks, or magical effects.

## Behaviour

When ```Emit``` is active, the system periodically spawns new particles inside the defined ```emitArea```.
Each new particle is configured using the provided behavior lambda, then added to the scene and updated every frame.

Particles automatically expire once their lifetime ends, at which point they are destroyed and removed from the system.

A debug visualization is also available, rendering the emission area as an outline in the scene.

## Constructors

### Default Constructor
```cpp
ParticleSystem()
```

Creates a new ```ParticleSystem``` with no emission. Emission begins only after Emit is called.

## Parameters

* ```Time delay```: Interval between consecutive particle emissions.

* ```ShapePtr emitArea```: Area from which particles are spawned (rect, circle, or polygon).

* ```bool enableCollision```: Whether emitted particles participate in collisions.

## API

### SetDelay
```cpp
void SetDelay(Time delay)
```

Defines the emission interval.

### SetEmitArea
```cpp
void SetEmitArea(ShapePtr emitArea)
```

Sets the spawn area for new particles.

### Emit
```cpp
void Emit()
```

Starts emitting particles.

### Stop
```cpp
void Stop()
```

Stops emission and resets timer.


# ‚ú≥Ô∏è Particle

The ```Particle``` entity represents a lightweight physics-driven object with a limited lifetime, typically used for visual effects such as sparks, smoke, or debris.
It exposes basic physical properties (density, friction, restitution, damping, velocity) and can optionally interact with the physics world through collisions.
Particles are managed by a ```ParticleSystem``` and are not intended to behave as full gameplay entities.

## Behaviour

On every update, the particle reduces its lifetime and updates its transform based on the underlying physics body.
Once its lifetime reaches zero, the particle is destroyed and removed from the system.

Particles can receive forces, impulses, velocities, damping, and torque to control their short-lived behavior.

## Constructors

### Default Constructor
```cpp
Particle()
```

Creates a new ```Particle``` instance with default parameters. The physics body is created when ```Create``` is called.

## Public Fields

* ```Time lifetime```: Duration until the particle is automatically destroyed.

* ```Transform transform```: Current world position and rotation of the particle.

* ```ShapePtr shape```: Collision shape of the particle (default: 25√ó25 rectangle).
