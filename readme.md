Alce Game Engine is a game engine based on SFML and Box2D, designed to simplify the development of 2D games. Its primary goal is to provide a comprehensive suite of tools and components that streamline the creation process. From physics simulations and animations to user interface management and local storage.

# üì∞ News and Updates

> [üåê See full page here](Documentation/News/News.md)

### > (6/9/2025) TileMap Component Released

The new TileMap component is now available. It lets you render tile-based maps exported from PyxelEdit directly on a GameObject, handling tilesets, layers, flips, and rotations automatically, while keeping the map centered on the object‚Äôs transform and updating its bounding corners for efficient scene culling. Perfect for creating levels, backgrounds, or any grid-based environment.

### > (24/8/2025) TextRenderer Component Released

The new TextRenderer component is now available. It allows you to render styled text directly in the game world, with support for formatting, colors, backgrounds, and borders. Useful for names, dialogue, or any text that should exist as part of the scene rather than the UI.

### > (3/8/2025) Candle Lighting Now Available in AlceEngine

We're excited to introduce a new integration of Candle into AlceEngine, bringing advanced 2D lighting capabilities to your SFML projects. This implementation includes support for radial and directional lights, fog-based lighting areas, and custom light meshes with support for rectangular, circular, and polygonal shapes. 

Designed to be modular and easy to use within the AlceEngine's component system, this integration enables dynamic lighting effects, real-time intensity control, and debug visualizations to streamline your workflow.

# üìñ Documentation

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Documentation effort is still in progress.

AlceEngine provides structured and comprehensive documentation for every component, method, and feature, making it easy for developers to understand, integrate, and utilize the engine‚Äôs functionality efficiently. Each part of the engine is clearly explained, ensuring that users can quickly find the information they need without confusion.
