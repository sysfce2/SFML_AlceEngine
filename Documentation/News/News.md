### > (6/9/2025) TileMap Component Released

The new TileMap component is now available. It lets you render tile-based maps exported from PyxelEdit directly on a GameObject, handling tilesets, layers, flips, and rotations automatically, while keeping the map centered on the objectâ€™s transform and updating its bounding corners for efficient scene culling. Perfect for creating levels, backgrounds, or any grid-based environment.

### > (24/8/2025) TextRenderer Component Released

The new TextRenderer component is now available. It allows you to render styled text directly in the game world, with support for formatting, colors, backgrounds, and borders. Useful for names, dialogue, or any text that should exist as part of the scene rather than the UI.

### > (3/8/2025) Candle Lighting Now Available in AlceEngine

We're excited to introduce a new integration of Candle into AlceEngine, bringing advanced 2D lighting capabilities to your SFML projects. This implementation includes support for radial and directional lights, fog-based lighting areas, and custom light meshes with support for rectangular, circular, and polygonal shapes. 

Designed to be modular and easy to use within the AlceEngine's component system, this integration enables dynamic lighting effects, real-time intensity control, and debug visualizations to streamline your workflow.

### > (03/03/2025) Release: Alce Runtime Language (ARL)

A lightweight, human-readable command language designed for dynamic scene development and modification during runtime. It allows you to make real-time changes without the need for recompilation, streamlining iterative workflows in applications such as game development or interactive simulations.
 
Just write your prompts in the console while the game is running!
